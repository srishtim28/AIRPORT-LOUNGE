        - Amenities: {top_lounge['amenities']}

        Generate a short, appealing, and slightly enthusiastic description (1-2 sentences) for this lounge, highlighting why it might be a great choice for this traveler. Use emojis relevant to travel or luxury (like ‚úàÔ∏è, ‚ú®, ü•Ç, üõãÔ∏è). Make it sound like a helpful AI assistant's recommendation.
